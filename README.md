# TrailTracker

"TrailTracker" is a web application designed to help hiking enthusiasts discover, explore, and share hiking trails. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this application provides users with detailed information on various hiking trails, including maps, difficulty levels, reviews, and user-generated content.

The app aims to build a community of hikers who can contribute by adding new trails, sharing their experiences, and providing feedback on existing trails.
